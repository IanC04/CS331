    \begin{theorem}
        Prove that for any tree, the number of edges is one less than the number of nodes, i.e., n
        - m = 1.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Default tree: 1 node, 0 edges. Adding a node requires adding an edge, so the number of
        edges always equals the number of nodes minus 1.

    \section{Problem 2}\label{sec:chapter_2}

    \begin{theorem}
        Prove that such an algorithm cannot possibly exist.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Assume there is, then we can recursively apply it and get smaller files.
        % TODO Finish Proof
    \end{proof}


    \section{Problem 3}\label{sec:chapter_3}

    \begin{theorem}
        Prove that a bishop placed on that square can go to any black colored square on the
        chessboard.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Bishop can move diagonally, so it can move to any black square, which are placed in
        diagonal patterns.
        % TODO Finish Proof
    \end{proof}


    \section{Problem 4}\label{sec:chapter_4}

    \begin{theorem}
        Prove that this new board cannot be tiled with dominoes$\textemdash$that is, any attempt to
        cover the chessboard with dominoes must always have either an uncovered square or a
        domino hanging off the edge.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Removed 2 black squares, and since dominoes cover 1 black and 1 white square, it is
         impossible.
        % TODO Finish Proof
    \end{proof}
