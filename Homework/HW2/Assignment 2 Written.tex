    \begin{homeworkProblem}[Problem 1: Short Answers Section]
        For this section, restrict answers to no more than a few sentences.
        Most answers can be expressed in a single sentence. Unless otherwise
        stated, briefly justify. No proofs are necessary for this section.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
            True, since at first there is a root node with no edges. Every subsequent node adds one
            edge.
            \item
            True
            \item
            True, BFS would iterate every edge set of every vertex, so $\mid V\mid\cdot\mid V\mid$ edges.
            \item
            True
            \item
            False, DFS will in general output deeper trees, but not always.
            \item
            True, if there were multiple paths, then that means there's a cycle. Trees have no
            cycles.
        \end{enumerate}

    \end{homeworkProblem}

    \begin{homeworkProblem}

        \begin{enumerate}
            [=(\alph*)]
            \item
            True, we can alternate the colors in each layer of the tree. Then, every edge in the
            tree will be touching a node on layer$_n$ and one on layer$_{n+1}$, which are
            different colors.
            \item
            Nodes can't connect to other nodes on the same layer, as that would create an odd
            length cycle. However, they can connect to nodes on different layers, so we can
            multiply the count of nodes per layer together.
        \end{enumerate}

    \begin{homeworkProblem}
        I would run a breadth-first search, which has O($\mid V\mid +\mid E\mid$).\newline

            % TODO: Finish proof
        \end{proof}
